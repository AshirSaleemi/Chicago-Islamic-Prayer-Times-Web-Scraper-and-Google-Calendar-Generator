This project aims to automate the process of accessing the Islamic prayer times for the current month and year from the Chicago Islamic Calendar website. It uses web scraping techniques to extract the prayer table from the website and convert it into a CSV file. Then, it converts the CSV file into an iCalendar (.ics) file, which can be easily imported into Google Calendar or any other calendar application that supports the iCalendar format.

The iCalendar file generated by this project contains the prayer times for each day of the month, including Fajr, Dhuhr, Asr, Maghrib, and Isha. By importing this file into Google Calendar, users can receive notifications for each prayer time, which can help them stay on track with their daily prayers.

This project uses Python and several open-source libraries, including Beautiful Soup for web scraping, Pandas for data processing, and iCalendar for generating the iCalendar file. The project is designed to be easily configurable, allowing users to specify the month and year for which they want to generate the prayer times calendar.

Overall, this project is a useful tool for anyone who wants to automate the process of accessing Islamic prayer times in Chicago and integrating them into their daily routine. It is also a great example of how web scraping and data processing techniques can be used to create valuable tools for end users.
